One lock and condition was given to each station. Before each train moves, it takes the lock 
of the station it's at and the next station to prevent any other entities from boarding, 
arriving, or otherwise interfering with the current action. Passengers also lock the stations
they board or deboard on so the train does not move while they perform their action.
